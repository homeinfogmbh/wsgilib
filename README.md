## Usage
Following are some example use cases.

### Examples
#### Simple WSGI application
A simple WSGI application may be implemented using the `Application` class.

The following example shows a trivial WSGI application that will return the UTF-8 String *"Hello world!"* on any HTTP *GET* request.

    from wsgilib import Application, OK

    application = Application('MyApplication')

    @application.route('/')
    def hello_world(self):
        return OK('Hello world!')


#### ReST Application
For applications using **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer you can use the same routing idioms as with *flask*.

    from math import factorial
    from wsgilib import Application, Error, OK

    APPLICATION = Application('factorial')

    @APPLICATION.route('/factorial/<int:value>')
    def get_factorial(value):
        """Calculates and returns the factorial of the given number."""
        if value > 100:
            raise Error(f'Value too large: {value}.')

        return OK(f'{value}! = {factorial(value)}')

The above ReST application will return the following response:
* `http://<host>/factorial/12` â†’ *12! = 479001600*

### Return values
The framework provides return value classes to represent common data types.

#### Response
The class `Response` provides the very basic interface to handle responses from the server.  
It is a composition of the `flask.Response` and `Exception` class.  
All `Response` instances thus can be *risen* as exceptions in the code, ultimately being handled as return values by the respective `Application`.

#### Plain Text
To return simple plain text responses, there is the class `PlainText`.

However, this class should not be used directly, since it is being inherited by both `OK` and `Error`.
Those two classes check the HTTP status code provided during their instantiation and can easily be identified as success / error conditions when reading the source code.

#### XML
To automatically convert [PyXB](https://github.com/pabigot/pyxb) DOMs to XML responses, the framework provides the class `XML`.

#### JSON
To automatically return JSON responses from dictionaries, there is a class `JSON`.

#### Binaries
To return binary data, the class `Binary` uses the library [mimeutil](https://github.com/HOMEINFO/mimeutil) to try to detect the appropriate MIME type.

#### Internal server errors
For debugging purposes or to detect runtime errors within a productive system, the class `InternalServerError` can be used.
