# wsgilib
An extended WSGI framework based on [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/).

## Usage
Following are some example use cases.

### Examples
The `Application` class takes three special parameters that `Flask` does not.  
The flag `cors` causes `flask_cors.CORS` to be applied to itself if set to `True`, enabling [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).  
The flag `debug` adds an error handler for all `Exception`s to raise an `InternalServerError` with a full stack trace if set to `True`.  
The flag `errorhandlers` takes an interable of 2-tuples of error handlers, each 2-tuple providing the to-be-handled exception and handling function.

#### Simple WSGI application
A simple WSGI application may be implemented using the `Application` class.

The following example shows a trivial WSGI application that will return the UTF-8 String *"Hello world!"* on any HTTP *GET* request.

    from wsgilib import Application, OK

    application = Application('MyApplication')

    @application.route('/')
    def hello_world(self):
        return OK('Hello world!')


#### ReST Application
For applications using **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer you can use the same routing idioms as with *flask*.

    from math import factorial
    from wsgilib import Application, Error, OK

    APPLICATION = Application('factorial')

    @APPLICATION.route('/factorial/<int:value>')
    def get_factorial(value):
        """Calculates and returns the factorial of the given number."""
        if value > 100:
            raise Error(f'Value too large: {value}.')

        return OK(f'{value}! = {factorial(value)}')

The above ReST application will return the following response:
* `http://<host>/factorial/12` â†’ *12! = 479001600*

### Return values
The framework provides return value classes to represent common data types.

#### Response
The class `Response` provides the very basic interface to handle responses from the server.  
It is a composition of the `flask.Response` and `Exception` class.  
All `Response` instances thus can be *risen* as exceptions in the code, ultimately being handled as return values by the respective `Application`.  
The default status of `Response` is `200`.

#### Plain Text
To return simple plain text responses, there is the class `PlainText`.

However, this class should not be used directly, since it is being inherited by both `OK` and `Error`.
Those two classes check the HTTP status code provided during their instantiation and can easily be identified as success / error conditions when reading the source code.

##### OK
Retuns a plain text success message. The default status is `200`. Valid values are 200-299.

##### Error
Retuns a plain text error message. The default status is `400`. Valid values are 400-599.

#### XML
To automatically convert [PyXB](https://github.com/pabigot/pyxb) DOMs to XML responses, the framework provides the class `XML`:

    DOM = MY_BINDING.CreateFromDocument(XML_TEXT)

    @APPLICATION.route('/xml')
    def get_xml():
        """Returns an XML document."""
        return XML(DOM)

#### JSON
To automatically return JSON responses from dictionaries, there is a class `JSON`:

    @APPLICATION.route('/json')
    def get_json():
        """Returns a JSON object as described by the dictionary."""
        dictionary = {
            'id': 12,
            'name': 'my_object',
            'success': True,
            'issued': datetime.now()}
        return JSON(dictionary)

#### Binaries
To return binary data, the class `Binary` uses the library [mimeutil](https://gitlab.com/HOMEINFO/mimeutil) to try to detect the appropriate MIME type:

    @APPLICATION.route('/binary')
    def get_binary():
        """Returns a binary file.
        You can optionally specify the file's name
        via the URL parameter <filename>.
        """
        with open('/my/file', 'rb') as file:
            return Binary(file.read(), filename=request.get('filename'))

#### Internal server errors
For debugging purposes or to detect runtime errors within a productive system, the class `InternalServerError` can be used.
